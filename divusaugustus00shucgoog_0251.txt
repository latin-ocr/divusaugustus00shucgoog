Besides these, who seem to have taken an active part in the
assassination, Plutarch says that Gaius Octavius and Lentulus Spinther
joined them on their way up to the Capitol, seigning to have been
in the plot [Plut. Caes. 67, cp. Cic 2 Phil.¹ 525} Appian [B. ll'o.
2, 119] adds to this category Favonius, Aquinius, Dolabella, Murcus
and Patiscus.

Os these Gaius Octavius is unknown to us. P. Cornelius
Lentulus Spinther, though he thus openly joined the conspirators
[Cic. All. 13, ro; fam. 12, 14], and served at Philippi, managed to
escape, and was alive at least up to ac. ²7 [Eckhel 5, p. 185} M.
Favonius was executed aiter Philippi [Dio 47, 49: see note on p. 27].
Aquinius may be the M. Aquinius pardoned by Iulius in ae. 47
[llll. Afric. 57, 89], but we have no account of him aiter that.
Dolabella took advantage of the murder oi Iulius to assume the
consulship, but he soon showed by his execution oi Trebonius in
Asia that he was not at one with the assassins. He was driven to
suicide in Syria by Cassius, rac. 43. How lar he did at first openly
connect himself with the assassins is not clear, but for some time
Cicero was thoroughly satisfied with his speeehes and actions [Cic.

All. 14, 20-213 15,13; 16, 11]. L. Statius Murcus (once a legatus ¹

of Iulius) had been praetor in the year before the assassination, and

if he was in Rome at the time must have been ou the point os start- 4

ing ior his province (Syria). He afterwards did good service to the
cause oi Brutus and Cassius with his fleet; but joining Sextus
Pompeius aiter Philippi he was assassinated, owing to the jealousy oi

Metrodorus [Dio 48, 19]. Patiscus was with Cassiusas proquaestor y
in command oi a ship, rac. 4³ [Cic. sam. 12, 13, 15].
