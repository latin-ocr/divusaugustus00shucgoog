he possessed without question as to precedence or rights of
colleagues, and in all parts of the Empire alike. It was not,
as were his other powers, founded on any shadow of republi-
can magistracy, and was perhaps never exactly defined; but
as it placed Augustus in rank and dignity before all other
magistrates, so it gave him the right not only of exercising
those powers, uncontrolled by colleagues, but also of doing
everything else not included under them. Eventually it
came to be treated as the reality which it was, and Augustus
could speak of events moprincope, or ante mc principem, just
as he might have said me cornulo or ante me consulem ²⁰.

Like other powers of the new regime, however, it was

this novel power was not needed. From henceforth at each
renewal this ἡγεμονία or προστασία has ceased to have any
special connexion with the provinces, and applies equally-
t0 the whole Empire, and is, as Dio [53, 16] sayS, a real
‘monarchy'a It was this title and office which expressed

feeling in men’s minds that the two were in some senses connected: and 1 also
venture to think that ‘leader of the Roman Nobility' and ‘elect of the Roman
people' do not adequately express the ideas ever attaching to the Princeps.

it to have been a real monarchy, which the periodica] renewal [ma έτη πέντε, εἶτα

name for the office (which yet can only be the renewal of the first) ; in nc. 19 he
calls it προστασία [44, mJ, in rac. 8 ἡγεμονία [5 5, 5], in an). 3 ἡγεμονία [55, ra] 3
