its own number as advocate for the complaining province.
The injured provincials no longer depended on the services
of a patronus or on the verdict of a jurytt

(7) The postal service (in connexion with which must be
considered the improved roads) greatly facilitated rapid and
frequent references to the Emperor himself on details of
administration⁸⁵.

(8) The old abuse of the libera legatio, if not wholly
removeor, was rendered difficult and almost ceased to exist

At the same time such laws as had been previously passed
with a view to purify provincial administration-the lex
Calpurnia B.C. 149, the lex Acilia [Cic. 2- Verr. 1, 9], the lex
Servilia Glauciae B.C. 122, the lex Cornelia B.C. 80, the lex
Iulia Iac. 59,—remained in force so far as they were not super·
seded by the new regulationsr. The beneficent effect of the
change was promptly felt in many parts of the Empire, not
. least in Asia, where there set in about this time a period
ol great material prosperity.

§ 2. Susronrus, ars Lus nnn Wnrruvos

Like other writers of biography in ancient times, Suetonius
has found no biographer himself. Even the dates of his birth
and death are uncertainffl, and scarcely any facts of his lise
are known. He mentions himself seven times, but only briefly
to refer to what he had seen or heard as a boy or young man,
or to tell us his fathers name and rankae. Pliny the younger

³⁶ Suet. Aug. c. 49, p. 107 note. C. J. L. 14, p. 1 at Ostia there is a procurator

staff (cohors) of a governor liable to prosecution, without being able to plead his
authority for illegal acts. See Pliny Ep. 3, 9.

ω He was an adulescens ao years after Nero's death, ie. in au. 88 [Ner. e. 57]
and still calls himself so towards the end of the reign of Domitian [ob. run. 96,
Dum-121. The pen'od usually marked as adulescentia is from about 17 to 31.
Therefore he was roughly speaking not more than 31 in mn. 96, or less than 17
in nn. 88, ie. he was born not earlier than ab. 71. The year an. 75 seems the
most probable, as we find that he had been promised a military tribuneship in
mn. roo [Plin. Ep. 3, 81. His death occurred at some time previous to nn. 160.
