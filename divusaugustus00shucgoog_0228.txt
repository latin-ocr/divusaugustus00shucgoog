APPENDIX A.

Ι. MONUMENTUM ANCYRANUM.

Os the three volumina left by Augustus the second was an index
rerum a se gestarum (c. 101; Dio 56, 33) which he wished to be
engraved on bronze tablets to be affixed to the lront ol the Mausoleum.
This was no doubt done, but these tablets have long disappeared.
Fortunately a copy was also it seems commonly eugraved ou temples
ol ‘Augustus and Rome’ in the provinces with a Greek version as
the κοινὴ διάλεκτος. Os these copies one remains fairly complete
on the walls of a temple at Ancyra in Galatia [Angora], and some
fragments at Apollonia in Pisidia. The first partial copy of the Latin
version was made by a Dutchman, Augerius Busbequius, when on a
missiou to Soliman in 1555, and was printed by Andrew Schott in
an edition os Aurelius Victor (1577). This however was a mere

fragment os the whole; and since that time various attempts have
been made to obtain a complete copy, as by Daniel Cosson, Dutch

Vicecousul at Smyrna (in the 17th century), aud the Frenchmau
Paul Lucas by the order of Louis XIV. At length iu 1861 Napoleon

111. obtained a complete transcript by the exertions ol G. Perrot
and E. Guillaume. Finally‚ in 1882, C. Humana obtained a plaster
cast ol the whole, both Greek and Latin, in a series os plates which
were salely deposited in the Museum at Berlin. This is the founda-
tion ol the text as restored and revised by Mommsen in 1883.
