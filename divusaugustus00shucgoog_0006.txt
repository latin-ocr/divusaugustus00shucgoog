PREFACE.

HE main object of thisvolume is historical. Though
1 hope that Ι have not neglected important points of
textual and grammatical criticism, my chief desire has been
to illustrate the work of Suetonius by putting before the
reader, as fully as space would permit, the materials which
exist for constructing the history of the life and times of

Augustus, and which expand and explain the necessarily

brief and summarised statements in the Biography itself.
1 have therefore quoted freely from Dio and other writers, ·
and have printed in an appendix the entire Monumentum
Ancyranum (as emended and restored by Mommsen), with
dates and slight marginal indications of subject-matter, which
1 hope may render it more readily available. To this 1 have
subjoined a few other inscriptions illustrating special points
in the Emperor's life, in addition to a considerable number
transcribed in the notes

1 feel, on looking back on my work, that 1 may at times
have sacrificed to this object of historical illustration some
critical discussions on text or language, such as might justly
have been expected. For Suetonius, like all good writers,
has a strongly marked individuality of style, and his own
peculiar method of manipulating word-forms and construc-
tions. It is not safe criticism to class all such as accounted
for by the usage of the ‘silver age,' that is, after all, a usage
other than that of Caesar and Cicero. Suetonius differs as
much in style from such writers as Velleius, Florus, Pliny,
