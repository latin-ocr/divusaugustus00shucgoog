This account is not consistent with
what Suetonius himself says of the
habits of A stus as to military re·
wards [c. αὲΐῃος with his statement
that the ornamenta triumphalia were
first granted to Tiberius for his German
victories ac. 15-9 [Suet. Tib. 9]. Nor
again are anything like thirty triumphs
recorded in the Fasti, even if all are
counted after the death of Iulius. After
nc. 30 in fact only seven triumphs are
there recorded: M. Licinius Crassus
ex Thraecis et Getis (uc. 28); M. Va·
lerius Messala Corvinus ex Gallia(13.c.
27); Sex. Appuleius ex Hispania (3.0.
26); L. Sempronius Atratinus ex Afris
(ue. ar); L. Cornelius Balbus eu Afris
(nc. 19); and two of Tiberius ex Ger·
roranti (ne. 73 aa). ra). To these may
be added the triumph of C. Cassius de
Morinis [Dio 51, rr]. In fact Augustus
seems to have been very chary of this
honour, and interfered with triumphs
voted to Tiberius in nc. ra [Dio 54, 31]
and Drusus in ne. 11 [Dio 54, 3513
and Agrippa, who knew his master’s
sentiments, persistently decliued to ac·
cept a triumph or even the ornamenta
triumphalia [Dio 54, rr, 24]. But
others were less scru ulons, and this last
honour was somewllat easily bestowed

llbertssauatorum. The tradition that
Senators brought their sous with them
into the curia is ridiculed b Polybius
3, 203 referring it seems to the story of
Papirius Praetextatus, said to have been

narrated by the elder Cato [Gell. 1, 23 ;

Macrob. 1, 6, 18]. It appears, how·
ever, that they accompanied their
parents, but remained at the open doors
as the plebeian tribunes had originally
done [Valer. Max. a, r, 93 Willems,
leSinat, a, p· 163}

It is to be observed in regard to this
privilegegrantedbyAugustustothesons
of Senators that, though they were not
senators,theynowbelonged(asfarasthe
3rd degree) to the ordo senatorius: dig. 1,

this arrangement of Augustus there were

admission to the Senate: cp. Seneca Ep.
