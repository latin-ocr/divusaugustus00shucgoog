APPENDlX B.

THE ASSASSINS OF IULIUS.

To avenge his great-uncle’s murder was the first object os Octavian
[c 10, M. A 1]. The revenge took gradually a wider sweep, bu't it
was in the first place to be exacted from those who had taken actual
part in the murder. Os these men Suetonius [Caesar 80] says that
scarcely any survived their victim more thari three years, or dieda
natural death. All were condemned under the lex Pedaia, and were
either executed, or perished by shipwreck, or fell in battle, or killed
themselves. Dio [48, 1] says that all but a few met with the fate
which the murder ol a benefactor deserved. Plutarch [Caes. 69]
declares that the Fortune which attended Caesar in his lisetime
became an avenging spirit after his death, pursuing and tracking his
murderers over land and sea till none were left. It is scarcely
possible to test this statement completely, sor the number privy to
the conspiracy was large—60 according to Suetonius [Caes. 80],
‘some obscure and some young’ [Cic. 2 Phil. ξ 26], and accordingly
many oi their names are unknown to us ; but with some exceptions
it is confirmed by what we leam ol those whose names have been
preserved.

The most extensive list os names is that given by Appian B. cab.
2, 111-113, but some are learnt from other sources. They are:
