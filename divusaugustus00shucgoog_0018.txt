INTRODUCTION.

ς 1. AUGUSTUS.

nl( THOUGH containing valuable material ior biography and
history the work of Suetonius is neither history M ,l d
nor biography. By rejecting chronological arrange· 44ῗέἴῖ
ment he puts it out oi his power to trace the {imai
connexion oi events, or the effectos circumstances

in developing character. ΙΑ number oi detached facts are
told us of the conduct and policy oi Augustus in various
departments oi government or personal habit, and we are
leit to sort and fit them into their proper place by the help
of others. Even if something is gained by this method‚ in
giving a view oi his policy on each particular department
cn blac, more still is lost by putting out of view all that
explains motives, and justifies or condemns actionssuetonius
seldom passes a moral judgment. He tells us facts or rumours
and leaves us to form our own] He in no way emphasizes
what has struck so many modern critics oi Augustus—the
surprising change from the cold cruelty oi the triumvir to
the wise lenity ol the Emperor. And though Ι think too
much has been made oi this contrast by such writers as
M. Beule¹, a little more cleamess in distinguishing the policy
oi the two periods would have been useiul in helping us to

’ understand the nature oi the times as well as the character oi

Augustus

¹ Auguste, sa familie el ses amb, Paris, 1867-8. The evident reference to the
re'gime in France at the time perhaps gave a peculiar zest to the denunciation ol
Augustus and his crimes in M. Beule’s very brilliant and interesting, but scarcely
trustwortby‚ essay.
