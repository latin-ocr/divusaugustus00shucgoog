Sextus Pompeius had successfully held
his own in Spain against C. Cassius and
Asinius Pollio. After Caesar's death
Lepidus had been commissioned tomake
terms with him, and he had agreed to
submitto the govemment in return for
a restitutio in integrum and a restora-
tion of his father's wealth. On their
breach with Antony, the Senate had
endeavoured to secure his lo alty;
passed a vote of thanks to him liar his
answer to their commissionem at utar-
seilles; and finally nominated him com·
mander of the lieet [Cic. 13 Pactu ¹3
and 503 App. B. civ. 4, 83-43 Dio
48, 17]. Being condemned under the
lex Pedio, and placed in the proscrip-
tion lists by the Triumvirs, he sailed to
Sicily and was there joined by many
fugitive 0 timatists. He besieged the
praetor o Sicily, Aul. Pompeius Bi-
thynicus, in Messene, whom he put to
death after persuading him to admit
him into the town [Dio l.c.; App. 4,
85]. Accordingly Octavian sent Q.
Salvidienus with a large fleet to attack
Pompeius, proceeding himself to Rhe·

'um by land. Salvidienus was de·
lelated, and Octavian was shortly after-
wards obliged to sail to Brundisium to
help Antony [Livy ep. 123; Appian 4,
853 Dio 48, ¹9]- 11. From tac. 42 to
