also to defend himself in many actions
brought by those who professed to have
been wrongfully dispossessed by Caesar;
and in these actions he was frequently
worsted by Antony’s influence [App.
Belleia. 3, 33 πανταχοῦ τὰ πολλὰ ὁμοίως

had from the first hoped to get Octavius
on his side as against Antony. He
anticipated with pleasure the quarrel
that would arise between them—sed,

till the latter part of October that
the alienation from Antony was eom·
plete; when, on the latter leaving Rome
to meet the legions at Brundisium
from Epirus, Octavian enrolled sol·
diers from the veterans at Casilinum
and Calatia on the plea that Antony
was about to march upon Rome.
Though he had no authority for doing
this, the Optimate party hastened to re-
cognise him, in their hatred of Antony,
though Cicero doubted as to giving him
direct countenance [ego autem σκήπτο-
μαι, ad Art. 16, 9], and Varro and some
others disapproved. lt was not until

the 19th of December that thanks were '

voted in the Senate to Octavian, thus
implicitly recognising him [3 Phil.
5 39]; and it was only on the rst Jan.
lae. 43 that imperium was accorded to
him, with the rank of pro-praetor and
aseat in the Senate [5 Phil. ἐ 46]. It
is certain, however, that he was playing
a part, and meant only to use the Opti·
mates to give him the power of making
terms with Antony on 3 footing of
equality. He himself asseris that he
