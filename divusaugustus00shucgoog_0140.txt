The first sour items give a minimum.

the 44 monthly distributions of com

at different times gave relies to numbers
otprovincials(sometimesroo,0oo,some·
times more), by distributing tesserae,
entitling them to com or exemption
t'rom tribute in timesol distress, thevalue
of which tesserae he made good to the
treasnry: Μ.Α. 17 (this passage ol the
Monumentum is defective, especially in
the Latin). For instance in ac. 44
the province os Asia was visited 144
serious earthquakes‚ and Dio [54‚ 3ο]
says that he paid the whole year's tri·
bute into the treasnry, which is reckoned
at 96,ooo,ooo HS (4000 talents).

see Tac. Ana. 6, 43 donec tulit apem
Caesar..facta neumandi capia siue u·
suris per triennium, si debitis papule iu

usufructus of money, like that ol pro·
perty, is opposed to ownership.

mmmm aemam...smv1s. Wil-
lems [te Sirtat 4, 489-494) has satis·
sactorily shown that there was hitherto
no legal Senatorial census, although in
the later period of the Republic,acertain
amount os property was looked upon as
necessary soraSenator [Cic. ad fam. 13,
5 ς 4). Augustus first made a certain
census legally necessary sor eligibility to
office, and therefore tothe Senate. Sue·
tonius here puts the minimum at scopos
sesterces, i.e. double the ordinary eques·
trian census, and says that he afterwards
raised it to 1,aoo,ooo, or the census ol
three knights. This is perhaps partly
confirmed by Iuv. 14, 346 sume duos
equites, fac tertia quadringenta.. But
Dio says that the first arrangement was
an equestrian census, 4οο,οοο, alter-
wards raised to 4,οοο,οοο. See 54, 17

(The money in Dio is reclroned in de·
narii, and must be multiplied by 4 to
state it in sestertii.) Mommsen [Staatsr.
