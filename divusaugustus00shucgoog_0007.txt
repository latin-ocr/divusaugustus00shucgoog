viii PREFA CE.

as he does from either Caesar or Cicero. idiosyncrasy has
as much to do with it as date. It is easy to exaggerate
the difference itself. Caesar’s vocabulary, writing as he does
on a narrow range of subject, is a singularly limited one.
Cicero, except in his more private letters, aimed at a literary
purism which must have been remote from the common
practice of the day either in colloquial or written language.
The admission into literature of words in common use con-
stitutes a large part of the difference, such, for instance, as
the fondness for the frequentative forms like pensare (c. 2 5),
' pensitare (c. 66), grassare (c. 67), taxare (cc. 4, 41), and of such
irregularly formed compounds as inobservantia (c. 76) and
praecipitium (c. 79). OEgain, of the long list drawn out by
P. Bagge of words used by Suetonius which are not used by
Cicero and Caesar, or only in a slightly different sense, a
considerable number can be shewn by the practice of Vergil,
Horace, Nepos and Livy to have been current at and soon
after the end of the Republic. Such are appellatio c. 100,
austrinus c. 81, avius c. 96, cerritus c. 87, cessare c. 42, constare
c. 52, sedile c 43, subterere c. 68, titulus c. 31, and others.
In another class of words Suetonius has gone back to the
colloquialisms of an earlier age, as is shewn by the usage of
Plautus and Terence. Such are adapertus c. 5 3, condormire
c. 98, aquilus c. 79, invitare se c. 77. Some new words or
usages are naturally the result‘os new things, or a new view
of things. Such are actus c. 78, contubernium c. 89, exauctorare
c. 24, extemporalis c. 84, ieiunum servare c. 76, missilia c. 98,
notare c. 64, praecognoscere c. 97¹ publicare cc. 29, 100, missio
cc. 17, 45, recensus c. 49, breviarium cc. 28, 101, prosa (prorsa
oratio) c. 85.
ln constructions he is fond of using the present and
perfect subjunctive (for vividness) instead of the imperfect
or pluperfect, as in edant c. 5 5, exigant c. 49, observata sit
c. 94, fugatae sint c. 16; and after verbs of exhorting or
commanding he prefers the construction without ut, as monet
imitetur c. 3; and usually puts a subjunctive after onte...
