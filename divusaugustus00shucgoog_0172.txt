Such a contract was dissolved by re·

diuortium or repudium of a wife, but
only repudium of a sponsu.

remained faithful to him throughout.
After his death he joined the senatorial
party for a time against Antony; but
Cicero complains that he was lukewarm
[14Pln'l. ἐξ 7, 11; Art. 4, 153 rr, 5]‚
and at any rate he soon reconciled him·
self to Antony‚ and in ac. 41 was again
consul, it is supposed as a compensa·
tion for the repudiation of his daughter.

After her escape from Perusia, she fled
to Athens, where her husband met her,
but treated her with somuch disapproba·
tion and roughness that she fell ill. He

stmultata. The political quarrel
leading to the war of Perusia is enough
to account for this [Dio 48, 5 sq.], but
Martial quotes an epigram of Augustus
which seems to hint that the spretae
iniuria foratae entered into the ques-
tion [rr, 21].

Scriboniam [Tac. Anu. a, τῃ Wilm.
170]. This wasa purely political mar·
riage. Scribonia was aunt to the wife
of Sext. Pompeius (a d. of L. Scribonius
Libo), and Augustus was anxious to have
means of making peace with him in view
of the hostility of Antony [App. 5, 53].
As her son (P. Cornelius Scipio) by her
second husband was consul in ac. 16, he
must have been at least in his ryth year
at the time of her marriage to Augustus
(ac. 40, Dio 48, τό), and she must
have been many years older than her
husband. The divorce took place on the
day of the birth of Iulia, rae. 39, and
Dio says that its real reason was that
he was already in love with Livia [48,
341. She lived long enough to ac·
company her daughter into exile in
ae. 2 [Dio 55, 10; Vell. Pat. a, roo].
ln natumnatum, the first had been only
sponsa, the second uxor only in name.
