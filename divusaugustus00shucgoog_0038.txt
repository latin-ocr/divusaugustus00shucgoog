name. Among them perhaps the most important was Cre-
mutius Cordus⁸⁰, who wrote a history oi Augustus (περὶ τῶν
τῷ Αὐγούστῳ πραχθέντων), and appears to have taken so un·
favourable a view at any rate oi the earlier part of his career,
that his books were burnt or excluded from Rome during the
reign of Tiberius. Aquilius Niger⁸¹, of whom nothing else is
known, also attacked him, accusing him os causing the death os
Hirtius. In like manner Iunius Saturninus (equally unknown)
assailed his conduct in the proscriptione. Among other
writings M. Valerius Messala Corvinus (b. B.C. 64) composed
a work on the civil wars alter the death os Iulius. He died

, about 9 years before Augustus, and as he deserted Antony

ior Augustus soon after Philippi, and was the mouthpiece of
the Senate when offering the title oi pater patriae, his account
may be presumed to have been more favourable to Augustus⁸⁸.
Cornelius Nepos, one oi the older generation like Messala,
does not appear to have written a lormal history oi the time,
but in his Chronica or da uiris illustribus may have retailed
some anecdotes oi Augustusr. Iulius Marathus, who was his
ireedman and secretary, seems to have written some account
oi his personal appearance as well as of the prodigies that
accompanied his birth⁸⁶. On this last subject anecdotes were
also preserved by Asclepiades oi Egypt and P. Nigidius
Figulus⁸⁰, Pythagorean philosopher and mystic. This class
' of writer no doubt helped Suetonius in the composition of his
94th chapter, but could not add materially to the chief parts
oi the work. That there was plentiful material, however,
either in literature or tradition, is also shown by the numb‘er
of anecdotes (about= 80) recorded of Augustus in Pliny’s
Natural H istary⁸⁷.

⁸⁷ It may be observed that Pliny is the only writer who records one important

¹work ol Augustus, the division ior administrative purposes of Italy into eleven
regiones [3 ἓξ 46-1281. They were Ι. Campania (including Latium south oi the
Anio). 11. Apulia and Calabria including the Hirpini. 111. Lucania aud Bruttium.
