THE TEX T. xxxv

c. 2 5, p. 55,1. 5. Sicilia is evidently right for the Cilicio of
most uss. The same error occurs in Livy Ep. 58.

c. 30, p. 68, l. 5. 111111111. The later Camb. ns. 1111111111-
tlum; and it seems to me now more probable that in this and
similar places the numeral sign fis has been wrongly transcribed with
the singular case terminations of sestertium. See also c. 41, p. 91, l. 7.

c. 32, p. 75, l. 7. vicensimo [quintet The uss. have triten·
simo or tricessimo. See fragm. of the Lex Au'lia (formerly called Lux
Semelam 17, Bruns Fontes p. 59, C. I. L. 1, 49-54. -Itmay be

magistracies under Augustus, Dio 52, 20, Momms. Stautsr. p. 2 35.

c. 40, p. 90, l. 9. circove. This reading for circam, adopted
by Roth from a Pan's ns. and several others, is also in the older

c. 51, p. 109, l. 6. sed violentius, an emendation of Pithoeus
for sedulo lentius. Camb.² sedulo uiolentius.

c. 53, p. 111, l. ro. adoperta is the reading of the uss. but I
have on the whole preferred Roth’s adaperta. The point of the
former would be that Augustus closed the curtains of his sedan to
avoid giving or receiving trouble.

c. 56, p. 114, l. 3. 111 tntu. Erasmus for the mss. tribubus.
The latter might be defended by translating ‘among the tribes,’ ie.
in his tribe when the tribes were voting. Camb.l has trti.

c. 64, p. 124, l. 7. notare. I have accepted this emendation
of Lipsius with some doubt. For though writing in shorthand was
taught boys in schools, swimming was also a conspicuous feature in
early training, which Cato taught his son himself (Plut. Cot. 20) ; yet
perhaps it would be too much for a valetudinariau, like Augustus,
to do.

not seem to occur elsewhere. The uss. have etiam memorium,

Roth reads iu eius sinmn rempublicam. But Dio, who is translating
from Suetonius, has εἰκόνα τινα τῆς Ῥώμης [45, 2], and it seems some-
what forced to use respublica as=signum reipublicae. The Codex
Memm. has iu eius siguum reipublicae, but sinum would be likely to
drop out before a word so similar as se'guum. The two Camb. uss
