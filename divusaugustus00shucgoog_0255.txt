204 APPENDIX C.

Thus on N ero’s death, in nu. 68, all those who could trace their
· descent from Augustus or his sister had passed away, with the one
exception ol Iunia Calvina In nu. 7 the expected sucoession in the
Imperial family as far as Claudius is shown by an inscription on an
arch at Pawia, which includes Gaius and Lucius, who had died a few
years before, Wilmanns 880:

Tiberius is called nvovs'rr r. since his adoption in nm. 45 of
those named none but the last, Claudius, survived Tiberius (no. 37).
Gaius died in nu. 43 Lucius nu, 3 ; Drusus, son of Tiberius, in
ao. 2 3 ; and Drusus, son of Germanicus, was starved to death in
au. 33 [Tacr Ann. 6, 23-4], having been born it seems in hu. 7
or the year previous [Tac. Ana. 4, 4]· It seems strange that his elder
brother Nero b. no. 1, and afterwards (nn. 20) married to Iulia
daughter of Drusus s. of Tiberius, should be omitted [Tac. Anu. 3, 29];
he was starved to death in nu. ²9 [Suet. Tib. 54]. Nero and Drusus,
as sons of Germanicus (adopted by Tiberius), would naturally come
before their uncle Claudius. Gaius (Caligula) was not born till five
years later (no. 12).
