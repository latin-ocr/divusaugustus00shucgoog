AUGUSTUS. xxv

‘The word ‘monarchy’ was so odious to the Romans that they

‘never called their Emperors dictators or kings or anything os that
‘sort Yet, as the ultimate power in the State lies with them, they do
‘in effect reign. The various constitutional offices (except the cen-
‘sorship) do indeed subsist to this day: but the Emperor for the time
‘being manages and directs everything exactly as he chooses. That
‘they may seem, however, to possess these powers in accordance with
‘law and not by soree, the Emperors assume the several offices,
‘which, when there wasa free democracy, carried with them the
‘highest powers, with the one exception os the dictatorship. Thus
‘sor instance they frequently take the consulship 3 on quitting the
‘pomoerium they are always styled proconsuls3 instead os king or
Ι ‘dictator they take the name of Imperator, and not merely those
‘who have won victories, but all alike‚ as a symbol of irresponsible
‘power Dictatore or kings indeed they do not style themselves, since
‘those offices have been once for all abolished, but all their actual
‘powers they have secured by this appellation of Imperator.

‘The powers bestowed by these various offices are these As
‘Imperatores they can levy troops, collect money, declare war, make
‘peace‚ exercise at all times and in all places alike such complete
‘authority over the army, whether os citizens or auxiliarios, that even
‘within the pomoerium they can put to death both equites and
‘senators ; and, in short, can do all that the consuls and other magis·
‘trates possessed of full imperium would be able to do.

‘Again, as censors they examine into our lives and morals, hold
‘the census, and enter or strike off names from the rolls os the
‘Equites and Senate, entirely at their own pleasure.

‘Once inore, being invested with all priesthoods, especially that
‘of the Pontifex Maximus, and in the majority os cases being able to
‘confer them on others, they have complete control over everything
‘connected with religion.

‘Lastly the tribunicias power, exercised in old times by the men
‘os the greatest influence, gives thern the means os absolutely
‘putting a stop to any proceedings os which they do not approve,
‘and renders their persons inviolable, so that the least violence
‘offered to them however trivial‚ whether by word or deed, makes
‘the guilty party liable to death without trial, as being under a curse.
‘The actual office of Tribune they consider themselves debarred by
‘the sacred laws from taking, because they are always patricians, but
‘its powers they assume to the highest degree to which they ever
‘extended And accordingly it is by it that they reckon the years of
