xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

ξ 4 Tun Text.

The text oi Suetonius, though not perfect, may be regarded
as fairly satisfactory, and lew great problems seem to arise, at
any rate in the Augustus. The number of MSS. ol the vitoe
Caesarum is very great, the best os all being the Codex Memmi-
anus (9th cent.) in the National Library at Paris, and the next
the Florence Codex Mediceus (11th century). Roth holds
it not proven that, as has been maintained, all later MSS.
were derived lrom the Memmianus or from any one source3
though all MSS. have the same lacuna at the beginning of
the Iulius, and certainly the variations between such Mss-
as have been collated are not large or important. I have
collated the two in the Cambridge University Library ol the
12th and 15th centuries respectively, and the general result of
the inspection seems to be that the text had been thoroughly
settled before the earlier date. The two texts (setting aside
common blunders) are substantiaiiy the same, and offer little
assistance in such difficulties as exist. lhave noticed most
variations of importance in the course os the notes. I append
a few observations on special points.

c. 7, p. 12, l. 6. cubiculi Lares. The use. have cubiculares
(so both Camb. uss). The correction is by Lipsius.

c. 17, p. 38, l. 1. Gn. Domitium. Ι have admitted Cn. into
the text in spite of all iuss, which have Τ, as there seems no doubt
whatever that the praenomen of Domitius was Gnaeus.

c. 21, p. 48, l. 2. Suebos [some MSS. Suevos) iieel that
Suetonius ought to have written Ubios, but it is possible that he
used Suebi in a loose and wide sense.

1v. Samnium (embracing the Frentani, Marrucini, Marsi, Peligni, Aequiculi,
Vestini, Sabini). V. Picenum. VI. Umbria (including thetern'tory oi the Senones).
VII. Etruria. VIII. Gallia Cispadane. IX. Liguria to the Var. X. Venetia (in-
cluding Carni, Istri, Cenomani). XI. Gallia Transpadana. The division seems
to have taken into account both the natural features of the country and the dis-
tribution oi races: but though Suetonius is careiul to note his divisions ol the city
and his police arrangements ior the protection ol the country (cc. 31, 32), it is only
in a passing allusion to his visitation ol them that he mentions the regiones oi Italy
