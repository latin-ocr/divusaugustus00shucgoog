is the only contemporary who throws any light upon his lise.
From him we learn that he practised in the law courts; that
he taught rhetoric ; that in A.D. 100 he was to have a military
tribuneship (probably to qualily for office), but begged Pliny
to use his influence to have it transferred to another; that his
works were much liked and expected with some eagemess;
that he resided for a time at least in Pliny’s house, who de·
clares that the closer his view of him the greater his affection
lor him became⁴⁰3 that though he was married he had no
children or had lost them; and that Trajan accordingly
granted him the ius trium liberarum. The biographer Vo-
piscus testifics to his honesty⁴¹; and Aelius Spartianus, in his
lile of Hadrian⁴, tells us that he was secretary (epistularum
magister) to that Emperor, but was with others displaced
about A.D. 121 ior paying too much court to the Empress
Sabina. That is really all that we know of him. The fact
· seems to be that he avoided public life. He was a gramma-
ticas, a teacher and scholar, half philologist, hals antiquarian;
and the kind of literature to which he devoted himself was
not that which made a man conspicuous or generally popular.
He wrote no epigrams or panegyrim, no declamations or

plays. Nor was his birth high enough to make him a
personage in society. His father was a tribanus legtbnis
angusticlavius[0tlc.1o]; and his connexion with Pliny was
alter all that of an inferior to a patron, in whose letters
there is always, in spite ol their warmth, a certain tone of
superiority. Os his works (besides the treatise de Rhetoribus
and the fragment dc grammaticis whichwe possess) Suidas
gives us the following list:

(1) On Greek Games, one bookss.
(2) On Spectacles and Games at Rome, two books⁴⁴.
