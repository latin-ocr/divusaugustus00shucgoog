os AUGUSTUS.

The paucity of the contemporary accounts os Augustus
which have reached us has been already noticed. Suetonius
must have had a considerable mass of authorities at his dis-

posal, the greater part ol which has perished.

First among thern must be placed the Emperor’s own
memoirs extending to Iac. 24, which were published W utings
in his liietime or soon aster his death⁶⁷; more than osAu-
one collection of his letters⁶⁸3 his speeches⁶¹³3 State guum.
papers or discourses delivered orally from a written copy⁰⁰;
his laws⁶¹; diplomatum rationarius os the Empire drawn up
periodically⁰³3 edicts, some of which were on matters personal
to himseli⁶⁴ ; laudationes over members of his family or friends,
his grandmother, sister, Agrippa and Drususu Of the last·
named he also wrote a lifes, besides other compositions on
more general topics¹ enumerated in the eighty-fifth chapter.
Lastly, there were the three volumes lest at his death, con·
taining directioris for his funeral, a breviarium of the Empire,

⁶⁷ He quotes them in cc. a, 7, 77, 78, 47, 67, 74, 85, 867 de Grammot. c. 76.

spondence between him and Cicero in three books, frequently quoted by N onius.
That these books contained some of his letters is evident from one of these frag-
ments cum lter facerem ad Hirtium Claternam spurcissima tempestate, cp. Cic. ad
Au. 16‚9; 16, 77.
