'Sextus Pompeius was crushed in he. 36; the movements in
Northern and Southern Gaul were checked by Agrippa in
lte. 38-7 10; the Illyrians, Dalmatiam, Iapydes and Panno-

nians were subdued by successive expeditioris under Pollio in -

lte. 39, under Augustus himself in lac. 35-6‚ under Agrippa
and himself in uc. 34113 the Salassi who blocked the Val
d' Aosta were crushed in B.c. 34 by Valerius Messala12; and
Statilius Taurus had in B.c. 36-ς, after the degradation of
Lepidus, secured the loyalty of Africa and Sicily without
striking a blow¹³. These achievements gave safety and peace
to Italy, and the poet only expressed the aspiration of the
citizens generally in his prayer to the gods,

hunc saltem euerso iuverrem sucurrere saeclo
ne prohibete! ¹⁴ ·

The contrast with Antony, carving out kingdoms for his
own and Cleopatra's children, and credited with the
{miz} design of transferring the seat of Empire to Alex-
position andria, was easily drawn, and Augustus took care
fflfflf that it should be made very plain to the eyes of the
Α ξὲΐΜῖΜ Romans The two men had never been cordial
''40'32' friends since the young Octavius first landed in
Italy in B.c. 44 to claim his inheritance. Party needs had
brought them together; jealousy and mistrust were always
thrusting them apart. Reconciliations had again and again
been effected, now by the intervention of friends and ministers,
now by that of Octavia: but they were diametrically opposed
in disposition, purpose, and policy; and finally Octavian
deliberately brought on the conflict which ended at Actium,
when he thought himself strongest, and the case against
Antony most capable of being represented in an odious light
to the citizens.
Actium and the suicide of Antony and Cleopatra gave
him all that he hoped. He was now left alone3 the
ᾗζῖἴέζ old oligarchical party was destroyed; the legions,
31alllong weary of civil war, were ready to be disbanded if
