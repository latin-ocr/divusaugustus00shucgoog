xxiv INTRODUCTION.

Senate in Ite. 29 gave the title to him and his descendants&
and he therefore could and did use it as a regular title; but,
as he always had imperium in other ways, it rather expressed
a fact than conferred any fresh powers.
There were certain other functione originally inherent in
the consulship, but which since Ite. 443 had de·
ι volved upon the periodically appointed Censors.
The chief of these were the making up of the list
· of the Senate (lectio Senatus), and of the Equites, and taking
the census. The Censorship, much reduced in its powers by
Clodius in lac. 58, had fallen into desuetude during the civil

¹ wars. Two Censors had been appointed in Ite. 42, but had

refused to act; and, though the experiment of allowing the
appointment of two in B.c. 22 was tried, it was not successful.
Augustus performed the functions of the Censors partly by
falling back upon the old consular powers²⁶‚ partly in virtue
of special powers as praefectus moribusw, a contrivance for
exercising censorial powers without the office or name, as in
the case of his other powers. Thus in lac. 29, though Consul,
he seems to have thought it necessary in holding the census
to rest upon his tribum'cia potestas3 but in B.C. 8 and A.D. 14

ν he acts simply in virtue of his potestas consularis& which had

been given him for life in Iac, 19.

The general result of the concentration of all these powers
ff’ , in the person of one princeps is thus expressed by
styfflssi Dio, who speaks of course from a point of view
mli& of a later date, when the development of the

· autocracy had become more complete.

²⁴ Dio 51, 41. Perhaps Augustus may have claimed the title as early as ac.
43 in consequence of the vote bestowing it on Iulius and his children: rods παῖδας
τούς τε ὴγόνους αὐτοῦ οὕτω καλεῖσθαι ψηφίσασθαι Dio 43, 44.

Ν 1)ἰο indeed speaks of him as τιμητεύσας σὺν ’Δγρίππᾳ in lac. 29. But
Augustus himself enumerates this census among his consular acts with his
colleague Agrippa [M. Α. 81.

²⁶ Iulius had held the same office [Dio 43, 143 44, 51. What Augustus asserts
that he refused [M. A. 6 ἵνα ἐπιμελητὴς τῶν τε νόμων καὶ τῶν τρόπων ἐπὶ τῇ μεγίστῃ
ἐξουσίᾳ χειροτονηθῶ] seems to have been a life-censorship. Dio [54, 10, 30] asserts

that he was twice elected ἐπιμελητὴς τῶν τρόπων for five years each time, ie· ne.
19 and η, see c. 27.
