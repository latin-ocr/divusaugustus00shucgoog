bifariam laudatus The laudatio
preceded tlre buming. The cortege
was stopped opposite the place at which
the oration was to be delivered, the
wax figures os the ancestors carried in
it were arrayed on curule scats round,
and then some relation os tlte deceased
mounted the rostra to deliver the speech.
Polyb. 6, 53, 9. In case ol public
lunerals ,the duty of delivering the
speech was frequently entrusted by the
Senate to some magistrate [Quint. 3, 7

an honour reserved sor magistrates sor
some special services, and even when
the patriciate at large assumed the right
sor each os its members, it seems to
have required some authorisation of the

Rostro Iulia, a podium of the Heroon
Iulium, built by‘Augustus, to which
were affixed the beaks of the ships taken
at Actium [Dio 51, 19 τήν τε κρηπῖδα

τίδων νέῳν κοσμηθῆναι...ἔ·γνωσον]. The
rostra as made by Caesar were not quite
a reproduction ol the older rostra, lor
some of the statues were removed. See
Cic. 9 Phil. 5 4. (An old emendation
was a Tiberio pro rostras ; rub romnus
a Druso. The expression suh veteribus,
sc. tabernis was the designation oi a
street along one side oi the Forum.)

exceptions were the Vestal virgins and
certain families (virtutis cansa) such as
the Valerii and Fabricii, who however
soon ceased to avail themselves of the
privilege. Even on the Campus it
was only allowed on special occasions.
Again‚ to have a monument on the
Campus or elsewhere in the city was an
honour rarely granted and required a
SCtumoralex. See C.I.L. 1, p. 186.
