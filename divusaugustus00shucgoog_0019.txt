xiv INTRODUCTION.

ln a sense indeed there was a singular unity in his cha-
racter and career. ‚without his great-uncle's bril·
liant qualities (especially as a general) he avoided
many of his mistakes. He was able to retain the
services and fidelity of men best suited to carry out the
measures demanded by the time; and he had learnt the
statesman’s secretos effecting his objects without fatally em-
bittering opponents or alienating friends. These qualities had
shown themselves in the young man: they accompanied him
and secured his success through nearly half a century of a vast ¹
and difficult government. When we consider the distracted
state os Rome during the last thirty years of the Republic and
the scandalous abuses in the provinces3 and when we farther

tragicos? writers considerably posterior in time. Among
Augustus. them the first place must be given to Dio Cassius,
a writer oi the 2nd and 3rd centuriesl, who with many foibles
tells a straightiorward story with (I think) an
evident intention of neither withholding nor mis-
representing facts. Here and there doubtless as
in most writers, inaccuracies whether from mistake or pre-
judice may be detected in him3 but on the whole his state-

coins and inscriptions, Considering the length and import-
