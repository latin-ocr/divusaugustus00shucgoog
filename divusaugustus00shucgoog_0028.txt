A UGUSTUS. xxiii

the unity of the Empire in the face of the world of foreign
nations, and the coordination of all powers and offices under
the supreme control of one, who yet had adopted a title so
little arrogant that it might be interpreted as merely giving a
first place in dignity, and a right to take the lead on all
occasions of ceremony. Other titles suggested departmental
functions, this an imperial and universal supremacy. Other
titles might be and were (at any rate in name) shared with
others, this could be applied to one alone.

But though this title in a sense included all others, yet he
also bore others indicating the particular spheres in which his
powers were to be exercised; often in conjunction with col·
leagues. Thus the title Imperator had two meanings. (1) It
belonged to a magistrate with imperium. (2) lt was
bestowed by acclamation on a victorious general
by his soldiersss. If this were confirmed by the Senate, it
could, it seems be assumed as a perpetual title. Augustus
at any rate so assumes it. Thus in an inscription recording
the formation of the Triumvirate‚ Caesar alone has the title,
given him by his soldiers after the battles at Mutina¹⁸ and
confirmed by the Senate,...nnrnrvs M. nunourvs. uun.
CAESAR 111er R. P. C. A.D. IV KAL. DEC. Ab. PRlD. CAL. 1AN.
SEXT. [Orell. 594], Thus again in the Consular Fasti for
B.c. 33 he is entered as ΙΜΡ. CAESAR, and so henceforth. Eut
he was also imperator because another formal vote of the

Imperator.

which therefore he considers (so far as it was a definite office) to have grown out
of the original ἀρχή of the Imperial provinces. It may be worth while to observe
that of the two passages in which Augustus speaks of himself as princeps in the
Mon. An. [cc. 30 aud 321, in the former he is referring to an extension of the
frontier‚ in the latter to his relations with foreign powers. He was indeed princeps
civitatis to the citizens, but above all he was princeps as representing the Empire
to the outside world.

²⁹ Dio 43, 44. The vote in the Senate in nc. 44 confirmed by the Senate on
the 16th of April [Ov. F. 4, 673]. An inscription of uc· 29 [Wilm. 879] gives us
the title in both senses: snuarvs· rovuuvs·Qun·nouauvsuurucnssnur·o·
