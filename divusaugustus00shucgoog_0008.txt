PREFA CE. ix

qnam, prins...qnam, though the clause is not in any way
oblique, see cc. 4, 101; so pridie qnam...e0mmitteret c. 96. He
omits the preposition in with words conveying a well-under-
stood locative sense, such as continenti c. 16, regione (followed
by genitive) cc. 7, 41, municipalibus agris c. 13. For quippe
qni he often uses nt qni cc. 30, 66, 72; ior an non he hasen
c. 94; sor an sometimes nnnc c. 693 for illico he uses eoram
c. 27; for cx aduerso he uses centra cc. 44, 94; citra has the
sense of ante or sine cc. 24, 43, 66. He is sond ol' the con-
junctions sedet cc. 38, 45, 57, 70, 89, 93 ; and of sed or sed
qnidcm lor καὶ ταῦτα, cc. 16, 29, 68, 92, 98 ; tanquam and
quasi with subjunctive express the ground of an action
without necessarily any suggestion ol unreality, cc. 6, 7, 10, 14
plspeaking more generally the points to be observed in his
style are (1) its brevity. This is not the epigrammatic brevity
of Tacitus, that master ol the unexpected, who seeks to
impress his reader by surprising him. Suetonius is not
thinking os startling his readers: his brevity comes from a
. wish to express much with the least possible expenditure ol
words. lt is business-like statement that he is seeking, not
ornament or brilliancy. (2) Allied to this is his inconcinnitas,
his rejection oi the ‘periodic' style. His sentences are not
elaborated or arranged with a careful eye to the balance ol
clauses, order ol words, or intricate combination. To express
clearly what he has to say is the limit of his ambition. For
rhythmical prose he has either no ear or no patience. (3)
Thirdly, he is participiorum amantissimus. This too is a
peculiarity which arises partly from the desire of brevity, but
partly also from a perhaps conscious imitation os Greek

w&

These hints may serve as indications as to what to observe

in reading Suetonius. He is not a great artist in language ;
but he is a considerable grammarian, and his peculiarities
are not the result of carelessness, but rather of scholastic
precision.
