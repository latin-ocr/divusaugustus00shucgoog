Octavian had been attacked by illness
as soon as the troops crossed to Epirus
on the way to Philippi [Dio 47, 37];
and he does not seem to have recovered
when the fighting began near Philippi,
tor his physician had the night before the
first battle caused him to be removed
from the camp. This in lact saved his
lise3 sor Brutus storrned and plundered
the camp. Augustus himself said that
he had been wamed by a dream to
leave the camp, Καίσαρος αὐτοῦ δι’
ἐνύπνιον ἔνδον οὐκ ὄντος ἀλλὰ φυλα-
ξαμένου τὴν ἡμέραν, ὡς oriris έν τοῖς

the armies ot Brutus and Cassius after
the battle made terms with the eon-

insulting words to Augustus seems to
be the case ot Favonius. Another
execution was that ol Q. Hortensius
(son ol the orator) who was put to
death on the tomb oi C. Antonius by
order of M. Antonius, as being prin·
cipally guilty of the former's death
[Plut. Ant. ια]. Augustus himself
asserts that he spared all citizens, see
M. A. 3 Bella terraer inari civz'lia ex·

condemned under the lex Pedio, they, in
common with others in the Proscription
lists, were no longer cives.

successum...modors.tus est, ‘used
with moderation,' ep. Claud. 14duritiam

the meaning ol moderor is in Livy 37,
35. where it takes the dative, ...ut me·

Dio [47‚ 49] the body was burnt with
honour by Antony, and the head sent
to Rome, but lost at sea. Plut.Ant. τι
