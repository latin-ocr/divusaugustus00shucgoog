xvi INTRODUCTION.

ln no part oi the story oi Augustus are the disadvantages
, of Suetonius' method more striking than in the chapters
dealing with those constitutional changes by which the new
autocracy was gradually evolved. Yet in no department is it
more necessary to observe dates, the order of events, and 'the
circumstances oi the day, if we are to understand in the
saintest way how this immense and iar-reaching change was
accomplished. For such help we must go to Dio Cassius.
The situation may be stated somewhat thus Two evils
, were afflicting the Empire, disorder at Rome and
ss‘fsm' maladministration in the provinces. For the
ῗλῧέζῗῖ former the remedy in Cicero's eyes had been the
supremacy of a man at once powersul and loyal
to the constitution ; ior the latter sharper legislation and the
purification oi the law courts. Both had proved illusory.
Pompey had failed as a guardian of order, and a succession
of scandals had discredited the courts. Iulius had succeeded

caesar. tration os the provinces, sor which his legislation
had inaugurated a new and valuable principle. But he had
some special disadvantages. He had been in arms against
his country; he had been long a leader oi aparty, and ol a
party to which (though doubtless counting many good men)
the spendthrift and the reckless naturally dritted. Conse·
quently he was surrounded by men of bad character, to
whom he was obliged to commit affairs of importance⁷.
Again‚ in the course of party conflict he had roused many
implacable enmities and lost many friends. With all his
brilliance and clemency there was something in him that

provoked hatred and alienated loyalty. Nor was it oi slight
import that he had nearly all the learned and literary class
' at Rome against him. In spite therefore of the destruction

this monument, and in the whole field oi epigraphy, in reconstructing our know·
ledge os the early Empire, must hold the first place in our recollection and gratitude.

velit victor, sed etiam ut iis mos gerendus sit, quibus adiutoribus sr't parta victon'a.
