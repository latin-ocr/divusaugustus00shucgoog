AUGUSTUS. xxi

In the provinces it might place him in an equivocal position
in regard to the proconsul. ln B.C. 23 therefore a great
change was made, which in fact recognised the new consti·
tution that had come into existence. Augustus resigned the
consulship, which he did not hold again till uc. 5, and in
exchange received the proconsulare imperium, which was not
to be laid down upon his entering the pomoerium, and was to
be superior (maius) to the imperium of the proconsul or pro·
praetor in every province. He was also to have perpetually
the ‘consular privilege of bringing any business before the
Senate which he chose. He had already in ΒΩ. 27 received
special powers in those provinces in which there were legions,
but this new proconsulare imperium made him in theory, as
well as in lact supreme in all alike. Still in this new con-
stitution he clung to the shadow of popular choice and
republican position, and the tribunicia potestas, now confirmed
again to him for life, was openly treated as his most important
function: the years of his tenure of it starting from B.C. 23

inscriptionsss.

(2) The consuls however were still nominally head of the
State It was necessary that some means should Thermo
be found to give Augustus (as he was called since fflmpao
B.C. 27) ,in lorrn that first 'place which he already mg,
had in reality. It was thus, as Ι conceive, that the manceps
theory ol the principate took a new development. 'm'
It was not a development of his position as princeps senatus,
which he had been since B.c. 28.' That only gave senatorial
rank, bringing no privileges beyond the right ol being asked
first for his sententia, which as consul (who introduced busi-
ness but did not vote) would be of no value to him. The
name may have suggested the new title3 but it was used in
an essentially different sense. lts novelty and indefiniteness
were its chief advantages. His consular, proconsular, and
tribunician powers were very great, but after all had certain
traditional limits. As princeps of the whole State, on the

ι other hand, he would exercise whatevermagisterial powers
