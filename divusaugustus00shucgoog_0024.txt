AUGUSTUS. xix

the survivors of the previous generation were tired oi war¹⁶;
the new generation were used to a directing hand. The
problem was how to secure his power without offending the
prejudices oi the elder men too bitterly, or fatally obscuring
the hopes oi promotion and activity on the part oi the
younger. Hence was gradually evolved‚ with extraordinary
skill and sagacity‚ the theory oi the Principate. ,

The term principatus rightly represents the lact; it was to
be a primacy among other powers, as well as a nem&
primacy oi rank among the citizens. But this Why.
primacy was developed in two ways ; and eventually m‘ssa‘zfyfl‘
the principatus was attached both in men’s minds
and in practical fact to the second of the two. On one side
Caesar was to become supreme by combining the powers oi
the republican magistrates, with or without the offices them-
selves He was to be consul or to have consular power.
Though not proconsul, he was to have proconsular power.
Above all, though not tribune (which as a patrician he could
not be), he was to have the tribunicia potestas. This was not
all conceived at once. At first he was always consul, and
therefore the question oi the consular power did not arise‚
and the proconsulare imperiurn was thought of afterwards.
But on the other hand he was to be invested with what was
practicallya new office, though under a name which might
admit oi being regarded as only an honorary distinction, ireely
attributed to him by universal consent, and in virtue oi which
he should appear to the whole world to represent in his single
person the majesty oi the Empire: this was the principatus.

(1) And first the absorption os the republican powers.
The tribunatia potestas was the most important oi Augsatus
these; and his attempt to obtain the Tribuneship in ausoris the
uc. 44 seems to show that he had early seen that mm,-
this office, with its power oi initiation, obstruction‚ can magis·

and control, would give him what hewanted¹⁶. The ‘illl‘s‘ml'l

’ first step was taken in B.C. 36-3, immediately aiter bunesntp.
